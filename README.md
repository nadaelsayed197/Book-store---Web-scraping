# Bookstore Web Scraping Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is my first data project where I practiced **Web Scraping and Data Analysis** using Python.  
I scraped product data (name, price, availability) from an online bookstore for learning purposes.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries
- **Requests & BeautifulSoup** â†’ for web scraping  
- **Pandas** â†’ for data cleaning and storing in Excel  
- **Matplotlib** â†’ for data visualization  

---

## ðŸ“Š What I Did
- Scraped book data across multiple pages  
- Saved the data into a structured **Excel file**  
- Created simple visualizations (e.g., price distribution, availability)

## ðŸ“¸ Results
Here are some outputs from the project:
